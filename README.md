# Obstacle avoidance using ROS and yumi.

This project aims to implement an obstacle avoidance system using a kinect 1.0 for detecting 3D objects.
Once the object is detected, source and destination is programmed uisng Lead Through using YUMI. ROS then plans a path
which is not in collision with the 3D objects or the robot itself and sends the path to yumi/Robotware and executes the
path.



## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 14.04
- Ros Indigo
- Ros industrial robot client
- openNI drivers
- ros abb drivers
- RobotStudio 6.04 or above.



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

```
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit-full
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni-camera ros-indigo-openni-launch
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-industrial-robot-client
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-abb-driver
```

Edit freenect-xyz.launch 

```
sudo gedit /opt/ros/indigo/share/freenect_launch/launch/examples/freenect-xyz.launch

```
and include before <\/launch>
```
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="yumi" args="1.42 -0.05 -0.26 -3.14 -1.57 3.14  /camera_link /world 100"/>
```
This is the static transform between camera node and the robot node.

ROS:


- The MoveIt! config files are in the package test1_moveit_config
- The description (URDF and meshes) are in testpack
- The launch file with Kinect and Octomap integrated is execute.launch. Most launch files have been commented reasonably well, and the parameters have been set to required values/states in all cases.
- The file execute.launch is set up to accept one of 2 possible parameters:
- If you want to connect to the real robot, set robot_ip:=10.140.60.194
- If a sim is fine, set sim:=true
- Important- have to set one of the above 2, as sim is false by default, and if false, it looks for a robot IP.
- The Kinect data being used is part of the launch file freenect-xyz.launch under the freenect_launch package. The TF between the Kinect and the robot is defined there, tweak according to requirements.
- The Python scripts in test1_moveit_config/scripts are coded using the Python MoveIt! API. The basic libraries used are moveit_commander, geometry_msgs, rospy, moveit_msgs.

#### Package structure:
- ~/ws/src
    - yumi_description
        - package.xml
        - launch
        - meshes
        - urdf
        - CmakeLists.txt
        - package.xml
    - test1_moveit_config
        - CMakeLists.txt
        - package.xml
        - config
        - launch
            - execute.launch
            - test.launch
        - scene
        - scripts
            - mainNode.py
            - test.py



#### RobotStudio (RAPID):
- There will be 9 RAPID files in total: 3 .sys files (common, messages and socket, which are common to all tasks) and 6 .mod files (2 each of stateServer, motionServer and motion, 1 for each arm).
- Use the install server tutorial on https://wiki.ros.org/abb for reference as to how to install and run the server.

- Here's the configuration->controller setup:

##### Tasks:
	
Task  Type	TrustLevel	Use Mechanical Unit Group
- MotionServer_left	SEMISTATIC	SysStop	rob_l
- MotionServer_right	SEMISTATIC	SysStop	rob_r
- StateServer_left	SEMISTATIC	NoSafety	rob_l
- StateServer_right	SEMISTATIC	NoSafety	rob_r
- T_ROB_L	NORMAL	N/A	rob_l
- T_ROB_R	NORMAL	N/A	rob_r
##### Automatic Loading of Modules:

FileTaskAll Tasks
- HOME:/ROS/ROS_common.sys		YES
- HOME:/ROS/ROS_socket.sys		YES
- HOME:/ROS/ROS_messages.sys		YES
- HOME:/ROS/ROS_stateServer.mod	StateServer_left	NO
- HOME:/ROS/ROS_stateServer_right.mod	StateServer_right	NO
- HOME:/ROS/ROS_motionServer.mod	MotionServer_left	NO
- HOME:/ROS/ROS_motionServer_right.mod	MotionServer_right	NO
- HOME:/ROS/ROS_motion.mod	T_ROB_L	NO
- HOME:/ROS/ROS_motion_right.mod	T_ROB_R	NO


### Restoring Backup:
Restoring backup of robotware should load all the configuration files and automatic loading modules mentioned above. 
Steps to do that:
- Conncet controller to robot studio either via ip or service port.
- Request write access.
- Right click on controller and click restore backup and select obstacle avoidance working.

After restoring backup, below image should be replicated on flexpendent.

### Launching files.
```
roslaunch test1_moveit_config execute.launch robot_ip:=10.140.60.194
roscd test1_moveit_config/scripts/
python ./test.py

or 

roslaunch test1_moveit_config execute.launch robot_ip:=10.140.60.194
cd ~/ws/test1_moveit_config/scripts/
python test.py
```
After launching execute.launch below image should be replicated for successful launch.

![alt text](2.jpg )

```

- Set destination, move away. Press Enter.

- Enable lead through, put the arm in origin position, disable lead through and move away.

- In flexPendent:
    Open production window.
    Set PP to main.
- Press enter on ubuntu machine.
    Immediately press play on flex pendent.


```

###Troubleshooting:

#### Common errors:

- [ERROR] [1504001056.268201344]: Transform cache was not updated. Self-filtering may fail.
    
    - One of the four hidden services is not connected. Relaunch execute.launch.

- [ERROR] [1503498768.125601344]: Transform Error: "yumi_link_5_r" passed to lookupTransform argument doesn't exist.
    
    - One of the four hidden services is not connected. Relaunch execute.launch.
